## Borah
Borah was rolled out in October 2020 and is the third centrally-shared cluster Boise State has purchased.
The cluster is located at the Idaho National Laboratory’s Collaborative Computing Center (C3) and built through a partnership between Boise State, the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), and Idaho Power (IPC).

In addition to the above infrastructure, the Borah system also has another 68 CPU nodes owned by our industry partner, Idaho Power. When not in use by Idaho Power, Boise State researchers have access to up to 34 Idaho Power CPU nodes for their research. Borah also has various condo nodes, which are available through the short queues.

## Falcon
Idaho National Laboratory makes the Top 500 supercomputer known as “Falcon” available to Boise State researchers. For help setting up accounts, requesting allocations or access to Falcon, visit [https://www.c3plus3.org/falcon/](https://www.c3plus3.org/falcon/) or contact the Research Computing Support Department at [Help@c3plus3.org](mailto:help@c3plus3.org).

## ACCESS
ACCESS is the successor to the XSEDE program which provides a variety of cyberinfrastructure resources. More information on ACCESS can be found [here](https://access-ci.org/).

## RMACC
The Alpine Supercomputer is funded by the University of Colorado Boulder (CU), the University of Colorado Anschutz, Colorado State University, and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The supercomputer is available to members of RMACC (Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium), which includes Boise State researchers. To access Alpine visit [the CU Research Computing documentation](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access/rmacc.html).

See Alpine’s [specification](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clusters/alpine/alpine-hardware.html) page for system details.
